# Comparative Analysis of Object Detection Models: Identifying Drinks, Utensils, and Laptops Using Faster R-CNN and YOLO Architectures

This study provides a comparative analysis of two object detection frameworks: Detectron2, which uses a Faster R-CNN model architecture, and YOLOv5. Data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning were utilized to assess the performance of these models for object detection of common items such as drinks, utensils, and laptops. The evaluation criteria included mean Average Precision (mAP) at IoU thresholds of 0.50 (mAP@50) and averaged over IoU thresholds from 0.50 to 0.95 (mAP@50-95), alongside a deep-dive into the differences of the modelsâ€™ inference speed and parameter size. Based on the results, it was concluded that YOLOv5 outperforms Detectron2 in performance on the test set, achieving mAP scores of 0.885 at mAP@50 and 0.656 at mAP@50-95, showing its better accuracy and generalizability across the three classes. Further, the YOLOv5 model demonstrated better efficiency with a shorter training duration and a larger model size, which did not hinder the performance, but rather allowed the model to explore more intricate and nuanced patterns within the images. It is proposed that further inclusion of a broader and more diverse dataset, coupled with more precise, accurate, and automated annotation techniques may enhance the robustness and accuracy of the model.
